# Car-Game-Concept

A quick game concept created with Python and Pygame.

You can speed up, slow down, move side to side, with the goal being to avoid the other rectangles (cars in this instance).

Functionality includes:
-Game window
-Game loop with the fundamentals
-Events for movement, collision, and exiting the application
-Random cars, spawns, and speeds on the road
-Window boundaries within the movement events to prevent the player from moving off the screen
-Application will close if a car collision is detected, resulting in a game over
